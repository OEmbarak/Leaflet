## Introduction

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.
Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.
Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity! 


```{r }

lats <- c(25.286232 )
lngs <- c(55.376959)
popups <- c("HCT Dubai", "Higher Colleges of Technology", "UAE college")
map <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%   
  addMarkers(lat=lats, lng=lngs, popup=popups)
map


```
